        <h1>Apply to the Program</h1>
        <p>We're inviting artists of <u>any medium</u> to apply to become a part of the Artist Program through one of our five inaugural “open” rounds. In each round 20 artists will be selected for the program, earning themselves:</p>
       
       <ol class="steplist">
  <li>A token that signifies membership in the Artist Program and grants the holder the right to vote on the selection of new members.</li>
  <li>A small grant totaling 0.3 ETH to support the creation and minting of a piece of CC0 artwork.</li>
  <li>Inclusion on the Program's Artist Page, showcasing the artist's information and work as part of the program's collective of talents.</li>
</ol>

        <p>To apply, artists are asked to fill out an application and submit it to one of the open rounds on Prop.House.</p>

        <center><a href="coming-soon.html" class="main-button">Apply Now ></a></center>

        <h1>How it Works</h1>

  <ol class="steplist">
  <li>Artists apply to Artist Program open rounds.</li>
  <li>Artists are selected & awarded an initial grant (0.1 ETH).</li>
  <li>Artists create their artwork.</li>
  <li>Artists work with the Program Directors to designate their work as CCO + mint their artwork (splitting fees with NounsDAO).</li>
  <li>Artists receive the remainder of the grant (0.2 ETH) along with an Artist&nbsp;Program&nbsp;"Artist&nbsp;Token.”</li>
  <li>Program Artists can then use the Artist Token to vote in upcoming open rounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more information and details on each aspect of the program please visit the <b>FAQ</b> or join us on Discord to speak to director to a Program Director.</p>

    <button class="accordion-button" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"><h1>Minting Artwork</h1></button>
    <div class="panel">
        
    <p>Minting artwork refers to the process of turning a digital file into a digital asset on a blockchain. This process involves creating a unique, non-fungible token (NFT) that represents ownership and authenticity of the digital artwork.</p>

    <p>The process stores your artwork "onchain," for life, allowing the creator to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Claim providence over their work, creating an immutable record of their work.</li>
        <li>Allow others to collect and trade your artwork as a digital asset.</li>
        <li>Collect royalities and fees associated with their work, for life.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Minting work on the Ethereum blockchain has becoming incredibly simple and straightforward for users with frontends like Zora.co that automatically create contracts, and allow the user (artists) to easily bring their works onchain. Visit Zora.co more info on <a href="https://support.zora.co/en/articles/6685361-how-do-i-mint-on-zora">minting</a>.</p>

        <button class="accordion-button" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"><h1>How Voting Works</h1></button>
    <div class="panel">

        <p>Each Artist Token holder holds 10 votes in each of the ArtistProgram funding rounds.</p>

        <p>Voters are only eligible to vote on rounds where they received the token before the round begins. Voting takes place during a 3-day voting window. Voting takes place on Prop.House under each respective round.</p>

        <p>If you are an artist and were awarded a voting token, view Open Rounds and wait for the voting period to begin. Then, connect your wallet similary to when you applied for the round and cast your votes.</p>

        <p>Prop.House is a simple platform built to help distribute funds onchain. It allows anyone with an Ethereum address to submit a proposal. After voting the rewards are automatically sent to the winners eth address.</p>

        <p>Prop.House was funded by NounsDAO and we have chosen to use it for this series of Nouns funded ArtistProgram Rounds.</p>

    <div class="panel">
        <p>Along with the small grant each artist accepted to the program are eligible to recieve an Artist Token. Program Artist Token's can be used to vote on all future ArtistProgram open rounds — Creating a perpetual program where artists vote for their peers.</p>
        
        <p>Artists will only recieve the token after their artwork has been submitted and minted.</p>

        <p>Each token is an Ethereum NFT and will be sent alongside the remaining ETH reward to the same wallet address that applied for the program.</p>
