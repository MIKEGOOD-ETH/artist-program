        Congratulations on being voted into the Artist Program! 
        <br><br>
        Below you’ll find <strong>instructions on how to mint your artwork to the Artist Program collection.</strong> The process is simple: 
        <br><br>
        Winners will be added as <a href="https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8618354-what-is-a-collaborator">Collaborators</a> to the ArtistProgram Collection.
        <br><br>
        Winners mint their artwork with the required elements: Split revenue with Nouns and release under the CC0 License.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Detailed steps:</strong>
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h1>Step 1: Connect to Zora.co</h1>
        <p>Similar to how you had to connect your wallet to prop House, you will also need to connect to Zora with the wallet you submitted your prop.house entry:</p>
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-connect-button-1.png"></center>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect your wallet.</li>
            <li>You’ll be promoted to create an account if you don’t already have one.</li>
            <li>Add an email and set up your profile (profile picture, name, etc).</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h1>Step 2: Artist Program "Collection"</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Click  “+” or “create” and choose the “Artist Program Collection” under the Collection dropdown.</li>
            <li>If you are not already on the Base Network, switch networks to continue: </li>
        </ul>       
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-network.png"></center>
        <p><strong>A Note About Collaborator Access:</strong> After winning the Artist Program you will be added to the Collaborator list for this collection, making the collection available to you to choose on Zora. It will only appear for the wallet addresses that have been accepted into the Program.</p>
        <p><strong>For questions or issues, please join the ArtistProgram discord and reach out to a Program Director.</strong></p>
        <center><a href="coming-soon.html" class="main-button">Connect With Us on Discord <img src="images/discord-icon.svg" class="small-logo" ></a></center>
        <br>

        <hr>

        <h1>Step 3: Adding Your Artwork</h1>      
        <p>Add your artwork and the title of your artwork:</p>
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-your-art.png"></center>

        <hr>

        <h1>Step 4: Expand Advanced Options</h1>     
        <p>Click “View Advanced Options” to expand additional fields:</p>
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-advanced-options-extended.png"></center>

        <hr>

        <h1>Step 5: Price & Duration</h1> 
        <p>Fill in the price of the mint + duration:</p>
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-rewards.png"></center>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> We suggest the price be set to “0” for a free mint so you can earn “creator rewards” on Zora. Buyers pay a small fee to mint, and a portion of that goes to the creator. To learn more about these rewards read here. </li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> This is how long the mint will be available. We suggest 1-week or 1-month, but you can choose based on what you think is best for your artwork and collectors.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>





        <h1>Step 6: Splitting Rewards</h1>
        <p>We express our sincere appreciation to Nouns for their substantial contribution in funding our program and providing financial grants to the artists. We respectfully request that artists contemplate allocating a 10% portion of their rewards to Nouns as a token of gratitude. Please proceed by selecting the “Split” option and entering the Nouns OP Stack Alias Address provided below.</p>
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-split-example.png"></center>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Nouns Address:</strong> 0xc2B42Fc9F9D8B2Cf86C068CaE131088095480082</p>
        <p><strong>ArtistProgram Address:</strong> 0xc499540286cAA0192241C6b56D1A4e65cf2823cC</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Optional: </strong>Give the Nouns address 10%.</p>
        <p><strong>Optional: </strong>Give the ArtistProgram 10% of the Split to help further the program.</p>
        <p><strong>Optional: </strong>Give yourself (or anyone else you’d like a % of the split).</p>


        <hr>

        <h1>Step 7: Artwork Description</h1>
        <p>Add an optional Description for your artwork.</p>

        <hr>

        <h1>Step 8: Release Details</h1>
        <p>Select the Mint Start, Edition Size, and Mint Limit Per Address:</p>
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-details.png"></center>
        <p>We suggest the default options:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mint Start:</strong> Now</li>
            <li><strong>Edition Size:</strong> Open</li>
            <li><strong>Mint Limit Per Address:</strong> Unlimited</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But, as an artist you might prefer to mint a 1 of 1, of a fixed size collection. These options are left up to the artists. If you need help deciding, please feel free to reach out in the Artist Program discord to chat with a Program Director.</p>

        <hr>


        <h1>Step 9: CC0 License Attribute</h1>
        <p>Finally, you’ll find an Attribute section:</p>
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-attributes.png"></center>
        <P>Here we ask that you define the artworks License as CC0 (another requirement for Artist Program entries):</P>
        <center><img src="images/mint-images/mint-attributes-license-cc0.png"></center>

        <hr>

        <h1>Step 10: Finalize Mint</h1>
        <p>Click “Create” and a transaction will appear to “mint” the artwork to the blockchain.</p>
        <p>You’ll have two transactions appear, each costing just a few dollars in Based eth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Split Contract:</strong> The first creates a contract to handle the “split” between the wallets you selected in Step-6.</li>
            <li><strong>Minting Artwork:</strong> The second officially mints the artwork to the blockchain and releases the collection based on the setting you chose.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> After winning the round you've also been sent some Based eth to mint your artwork. If you have issues with this please reach out to the Program Directors asap.</p>
